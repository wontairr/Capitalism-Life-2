(W.I.P)
Garry's Mod Half-Life 2 campaign but with CAPITALISM

Meant to be played with the Lambda Co-op gamemode + ut2004 sweps + doom3 sweps + m9k heavy and assault + probably some other stuff,
(check the files that end with registerX if you want to change the shop and items that are used, its easy.)
